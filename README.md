# Personal Contact Management Application

I have used ReactJs to implement the front end and MySQL used as the database.
In this repo, there are two branches(main and master branch). Check the master branch for the Larvel app.

1) create MySQL database (database name: contact_manage_app) 
2) start the Laravel backend and React frontend
3) start the application by creating a new contact
4) in this application, we can create new contacts, view contact details, and delete contact
