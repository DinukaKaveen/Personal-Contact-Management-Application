# Personal Contact Management Application

I have used ReactJs to implement the front end, Laravel for the back end and MySQL used as the database.

1) import the MySQL database which included in the repository
2) start the Laravel backend and React frontend
3) start the application by creating a new contact
4) in this application, we can create new contacts, view contact details, and delete contacts
